export const DESCRIPTION = `Like a raven sent from Winterfell, I await your words, my lord. Days
            have passed, each one an age in this lonely watchtower. Will your
            message arrive before the White Walkers of silence claim my spirit?
            Or will it be a swift arrow, like one loosed by Legolas, piercing
            the gloom with tidings of hope?`;
