export const ABOUT_DESC = `Hi there! I&apos;m Erik Harutyunyan, a software developer with more
            than 7 years of experience in building web applications using
            Node.js and React framework. I have worked with various databases
            including Postgres, MongoDB, and Redis, and have experience with
            message brokers such as RabbitMQ, Redis Stream. My advanced
            knowledge of TypeScript and Node.js internals allows me to write
            high-quality, scalable, and maintainable code. I&apos;m also
            familiar with Golang and have worked on a few projects using this
            language. Throughout my career, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to
            work on a wide range of projects, from building complex backends to
            developing user-friendly frontends. I&apos;m always eager to learn
            new technologies and tools and to apply them to solve real-world
            problems. When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me hiking in the
            mountains, reading books on technology and programming, or tinkering
            with new gadgets and devices. If you&apos;re looking for a dedicated
            and passionate developer with a proven track record of delivering
            high-quality solutions, feel free to get in touch with me. I&apos;m
            always open to new opportunities and challenges!`;
